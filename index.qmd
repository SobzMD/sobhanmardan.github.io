**Turning real-world health data into drug safety insights**\
PhD Student \@ UBC \| Research Coordinator \@ Vancouver General Hospital

I am a PhD student in Pharmaceutical Sciences specializing in pharmacoepidemiology where I evaluate the real-world effectiveness and safety of drug therapies. 

For my doctoral research, I am studying oral anti-coagulation (OAC) therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Using causal inference methods applied to observational data, I examine whether patients’ frailty status modifies the effectiveness of OAC, with a focus on clinically important outcomes such as stroke and mortality.
